## The Mandate: Zero-Trust AI
**Cata Risk Lab** is a specialized technical auditing firm focused on **Algorithmic Accountability** for high-stakes industries. We operate as the "Technical Gatekeeper" for financial institutions and multinational enterprises deploying AI.

We do not build "creative" chat bots. We build **Sovereign Auditors** that enforce:
* **Data Sovereignty:** Ensuring data never crosses borders illegally (nFADP/GDPR).
* **Citation Accuracy:** If the AI cannot cite the source, the AI must fail.
* **Liability Containment:** Shifting risk away from the enterprise.

---

## Core Methodologies

### 1. The "Sovereign Audit" Architecture
We deploy **Compliance-in-the-Loop** systems that sit between your users and your LLMs. These systems audit every query for regulatory violations *before* an answer is generated.

| Jurisdiction | Compliance Standard | Our Solution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Switzerland** | **nFADP (Art. 21)** | Automated Decision Explanability & Data Residency Checks |
| **European Union** | **EU AI Act** | High-Risk Classification & Technical Documentation |
| **Australia** | **Privacy Act (APP 8)** | Cross-Border Disclosure Validation |
