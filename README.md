## 🌍 Open Source Mission

Cata Risk Lab builds **public infrastructure** for AI sovereignty. We believe compliance tools should be open goods—not luxury services sold behind closed doors.

Our mission: Empower any developer to run enterprise-grade sovereignty audits in minutes, democratizing capabilities previously reserved for Fortune 500 companies.

**Built with care. Powered by people. Open by design.**

We do not build "creative" chat bots. We build **Sovereign Auditors** that enforce:
* **Data Sovereignty:** Ensuring data never crosses borders illegally (nFADP/GDPR).
* **Citation Accuracy:** If the AI cannot cite the source, the AI must fail.
* **Liability Containment:** Shifting risk away from the enterprise.
